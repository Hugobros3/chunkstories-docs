# Common issues, Troubleshooting, & Bugs reports

## Common issues (really a FAQ)

| Issue | Known fix, workarround or poorly thought out excuse |
| --- | --- |
| The game runs like poop | Does your system meet the [recommanded specs](install.md) ? Try lowering the graphical settings and waiting for assets to load in. |
| The game looks like poop | Don't hurt my feelings like that. You can always help as an artist or a [shader guru](custom_shaders.md) |
| You call that a game ? Where's all the content ? | [Waiting to be created](mods_guide/intro.md) ! |
| Why isn't this made in C++ ? | C++ is overrated and there are already a good load of decent C++ voxel game engines. This is a JVM shop |
| Why must I register on your website ? | We're sorry about that actually, it's a holdout feature. You can help us fix it ! |
